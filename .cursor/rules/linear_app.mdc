When working on tasks in Linear.app, follow standard real-world software development practices for task lifecycle management:
	•	Start of Task:
As soon as you begin working on a task, immediately change its status to “In Progress” using the Linear MCP interface.
	•	Completion of Task:
Once the task is completed, update its status to “Done” without delay using the MCP.

🔔 Reminder:
Always move completed tasks to “Done.”
Forgetting to update task status causes confusion and disrupts workflow tracking.
